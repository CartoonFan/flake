Flake: FLAC audio encoder

The purpose of Flake is to be an alternative to the FLAC reference encoder
with the goal of increasing encoding speed and implementing experimental
features.

The FLAC format and reference encoder were created by Josh Coalson and are
hosted by the Xiph.org Foundation.  Many thanks!
