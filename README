Flake: FLAC audio encoder

The purpose of Flake is to be an alternative to the FLAC reference encoder
with the goal of increasing encoding speed and implementing experimental
features.

Neither the program nor the library have stable interfaces. Therefore, the
commandline options and the library API/ABI may change. After version 1.0 is
released, this will become more stable.

The FLAC format and reference encoder were created by Josh Coalson and are
hosted by the Xiph.org Foundation.  Many thanks!
